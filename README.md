## 🧠 Projects

- **NHL Hockey Analytics — Expected Goals (xG)**
  This project was a project meant for graduate students in the IFT6758 course. A friend of mine and myself decided to tackle it as a personal project and it is still in progress. For now we built a play-by-play data pipeline, engineered shot/context features (distance,   angle, game state), trained and evaluated models (logistic regression, XGBoost), and produced visualizations (interactive shot maps, ROC/calibration).

- **Introduction to Machine Learning – EPFL (CS-233)**  
  Classification on a tabular (heart disease) dataset (k-NN, logistic regression, k-means from scratch) and deep learning on medical images (DermaMNIST dataset) (MLP/CNN with PyTorch).  
  → [Repository](https://github.com/pierre-emery/introduction_ML)

- **Bioinformatics – Sequence Overlap & Assembly (IFT3295)**  
  Implemented dynamic-programming–based overlap alignment between DNA reads, built an overlap graph and reconstructed a longer genomic sequence from short reads.  
  → [Repository](https://github.com/pierre-emery/bioinfo-sequence-assembly)

- **Bioinformatics – Local Alignment (PLAST-like BLASTN) (IFT3295)**  
  Implemented a simplified BLASTN-style local alignment tool (PLAST): seed-and-extend search with contiguous/spaced seeds, greedy HSP extension, and bitscore / E-value filtering for significant hits.

- **Second Brain — Course Notes & Knowledge Base (Obsidian)**  
  Structured note-taking system for university courses related to machine learning
