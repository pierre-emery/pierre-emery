## 🧠 Projects

- **Introduction to Machine Learning – EPFL (CS-233)**  
  Classification on a tabular (heart disease) dataset (k-NN, logistic regression, k-means from scratch) and deep learning on medical images (DermaMNIST dataset) (MLP/CNN with PyTorch).  
  → [Repository](https://github.com/pierre-emery/introduction_ML)

- **Bioinformatics – Sequence Overlap & Assembly (IFT3295)**  
  Implemented dynamic-programming–based overlap alignment between DNA reads, built an overlap graph and reconstructed a longer genomic sequence from short reads.  
  → [Repository](https://github.com/pierre-emery/bioinfo-sequence-assembly)

- **Bioinformatics – Local Alignment (PLAST-like BLASTN) (IFT3295)**  
  Implemented a simplified BLASTN-style local alignment tool (PLAST): seed-and-extend search with contiguous/spaced seeds, greedy HSP extension, and bitscore / E-value filtering for significant hits.
